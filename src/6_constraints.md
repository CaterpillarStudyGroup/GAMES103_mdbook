# The Stiffness Issue    

 - Real-world fabrics resist strongly to stretching, once they stretch beyond certain limits.   
 
 - But, increasing the stiffness can cause problems.  
     - Explicit integrators will be *unstable*    
       - Solution: smaller time steps and more **computational time**.    
     - The linear systems involved in Implicit integrators will be *ill-conditioned*.     
       - Solution: more iterations and **computational time**.   
 - Can we achieve high stiffness, with a low computational cost?
