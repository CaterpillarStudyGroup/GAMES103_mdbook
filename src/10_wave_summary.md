P33   
## A Summary For the Day

 - The shallow wave model simulates waves over a height field.    

 - It’s based on a lot of simplification. We will discuss what fluid dynamics really looks like without simplification.    
 
 - The strength of the shallow wave model is its **simplicity** and **efficiency**. It can easily simulate water-solid coupling too.
